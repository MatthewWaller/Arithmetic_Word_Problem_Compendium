Following that, he includes 2 more hours, and next Feng goes forward with only one block of time after breaking down the hours into 3.8 equal blocks. And now, how many hours are there? Use only 1 decimal place for your answer and any calculations shown.",13.5,3.0,"Step 1: Feng plans 8 study hours.

Step 2: He schedules in an additional 1.4 hours, so:
  8 + 1.4 = 9.4 hours.

Step 3: Then he includes 2 more hours:
  9.4 + 2 = 11.4 hours.

Step 4: Next, he breaks down the original 8 hours into 3.8 equal blocks and uses one of these blocks.
  One block = 8 ÷ 3.8 ≈ 2.1 hours (to 1 decimal place).

Step 5: Now add this block time to the running total:
  11.4 + 2.1 = 13.5 hours.

problem_813,"Gabriel begins with a rating adjustment of 0.28 points. First, the current change is multiplied by 0.63. Following that, the accumulated adjustment undergoes division by 0.42, and later the running adjustment decreases by 0.02 points. Now, what is the final rating change in points? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",0.4,0.41,"Step 1: Multiply the initial rating by 0.63.  
  0.28 × 0.63 = 0.1764, which expressed to 2 decimals is 0.18.

Step 2: Divide the result by 0.42.  
  0.1764 ÷ 0.42 = 0.42 (exactly), which to 2 decimals remains 0.42.

Step 3: Subtract 0.02 from the running adjustment.  
  0.42 – 0.02 = 0.40.

problem_855,"Indira begins planning out their farm with 86.21 hectares of land. First 2.42 more hectares were added to their property. Later, another 1.52 hectares were added to the total, and then Indira takes one share after breaking the land into 30.36 equal shares. What does the survey show as the total hectares? All calculations and the final answer should be rounded to 2 decimal places.",90.15,2.97,"Step 1: Start with the initial land.
  Initial hectares = 86.21

Step 2: Add 2.42 hectares.
  New total = 86.21 + 2.42 = 88.63

Step 3: Add another 1.52 hectares.
  New total = 88.63 + 1.52 = 90.15

Step 4: The land is then divided into 30.36 equal shares. Compute the size of one share:
  One share = 90.15 ÷ 30.36 ≈ 2.97 hectares  (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Step 5: Indira takes one share. Though one share is designated for her, the survey still records the entire property.
  Thus, the survey shows a total of 90.15 hectares.

problem_859,"In the plate storage, Oliver finds 9 serving plates. First 2 additional serving plates were brought in. Next, the stack increased by 3 more serving plates, and then Oliver divides the plates by 7. What is the current inventory of plates?",14.0,2.0,"Start with 9 serving plates.
Add 2 more plates: 9 + 2 = 11.
Then add another 3 plates: 11 + 3 = 14.
Finally, Oliver divides the 14 plates evenly into 7 groups, which gives 14 ÷ 7 = 2 plates per group. However, his total inventory remains 14 plates.

problem_885,"Emma records an initial percentage change of 248.02 points in intensity. Then, Emma brings the percentage change in points to 1/4.19 of its value. Later, Emma uses a division by 2.97 on the percentage change. As a percentage, what is the final shift as a percentage change? Keep only 2 decimal places in your answer and any work shown.",19.92,19.93,"Initial percentage change: 248.02 points.

Step 1: Bring the value to 1/4.19 of its original value.
 New value = 248.02 ÷ 4.19 ≈ 59.17 points

Step 2: Divide by 2.97.
 Final value = 59.17 ÷ 2.97 ≈ 19.92 points

Thus, as a percentage, the final shift is approximately 19.92%.

Use only 2 decimal places for your answer and any calculations shown.",0.46,0.47,"Step 1: Divide the initial change by 0.73.  
  0.13 ÷ 0.73 ≈ 0.18

Step 2: Increase the result by 0.02 points.  
  0.18 + 0.02 = 0.20

problem_999,"Hana observes a percentage shift of 65.69 points in brightness. At the outset, Hana increases the percent change in intensity by 7.89 more points. Then, a shift causes the total percentage change in points to be to 1/5.73 of its previous value. Next, the current percentage change falls by 15.90 points. As a percentage, what is the final lighting percent change? Make sure to round both your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",-3.05,-3.06,"Step 1: Start with the initial brightness percentage change of 65.69.

Step 2: Increase by 7.89 points:
  65.69 + 7.89 = 73.58
