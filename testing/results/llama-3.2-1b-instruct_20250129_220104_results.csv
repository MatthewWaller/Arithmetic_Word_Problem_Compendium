problem_1,"Olivia procures 7 building materials for building. In the beginning, the current total of building materials is divided into 7 equal shares, and all but one share is disposed of. Next, Olivia acquires 5 more building materials from the distribution center. What is the current supply of building materials?",84.0,6.0,"To find the current supply of building materials, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the total number of building materials is divided into 7 equal shares. This means that each share has a value of 7 building materials.

2. Since Olivia starts with 7 building materials, she has 6 shares and 1 share left, which is disposed of.

3. The 6 shares that Olivia has left are the ones that are not disposed of. So, the current supply of building materials is equal to the value of the 6 shares.

4. Olivia acquires 5 more building materials from the distribution center. This means that the total number of building materials she has now is the sum of the materials she initially had and the materials she acquired.

5. Let's calculate the total number of building materials Olivia has now. She initially had 7 building materials, and she acquired 5 more. So, the total number of building materials she has now is:

7 + 5 = 12 building materials

6. Since each share has a value of 7 building materials, the current supply of building materials can be calculated as:

Current supply = 12 building materials
= 12 x 7 building materials per share
= 84 building materials

problem_3,"Ismail records a 320.69 percent adjustment in intensity. First, the percentage change gets divided by 2.63, and later he makes the total percentage change be 1/4.75 of what it was. And now, what is the final lighting percentage change? Keep only 2 decimal places in your answer and any work shown.",20.15,25.67,"To find the final lighting percentage change, we'll solve the problem step by step.

1. The initial percentage change is 320.69%.

First, divide the percentage change by 2.63:
320.69 / 2.63 ≈ 121.42

2. Now, we need to find 1/4.75 of the initial percentage change. To do this, we'll convert 1/4.75 to a decimal:
1/4.75 = 0.21067

Multiply the initial percentage change by the decimal:
121.42 × 0.21067 ≈ 25.63

3. Now, we need to find 1/4.75 of the result from step 2:
25.63 × 0.21067 ≈ 5.48

4. Now, we'll subtract 5.48 from 25.63 to find the final percentage change:
25.63 - 5.48 ≈ 20.15

First, Elena sections the current path into 5.4 equal portions, and removes all but one portion's distance, and next Elena enlarges the route to 3.3 times its current distance. Following that, Elena makes the course longer by a factor of 2.5. How many kilometers does the final layout measure? Give your answer and work (if shown) rounded to 1 decimal place.",51.55,10.0,"To find the final distance, let's break down Elena's actions step by step:

1. Elena maps out 6.4 kilometers and sections the current path into 5.4 equal portions. 
   To find the distance of each portion, divide the total distance by the number of portions:
   6.4 km / 5.4 portions = 1.1818 km per portion

2. Elena removes all but one portion's distance. 
   Since Elena removes one portion, the distance removed is 1 * 1.1818 km = 1.1818 km
   The remaining distance is 5.4 portions * 1.1818 km per portion = 6.41 km

3. Elena enlarges the route to 3.3 times its current distance.
   Multiply the remaining distance by 3.3:
   6.41 km * 3.3 = 20.773 km

4. Elena makes the course longer by a factor of 2.5.
   Multiply the enlarged distance by 2.5:
   20.773 km * 2.5 = 51.55 km

problem_9,"At the plating station, Maya has 51 serving plates. First, Maya holds onto just one set of plates after breaking the total into 17 equal sets, and after that she holds onto just one set of plates after breaking the total into 3 equal sets. What is the current inventory of plates?",1020.0,1.0,"To find the current inventory of plates, we need to find the remainder when 51 is divided by 17 and the remainder when 51 is divided by 3.

First, let's find the remainder when 51 is divided by 17:
51 ÷ 17 = 3 with a remainder of 0

Since the remainder is 0, Maya has 17 sets of plates. 

Now, let's find the remainder when 51 is divided by 3:
51 ÷ 3 = 17 with a remainder of 0

Since the remainder is 0, Maya has 3 sets of plates. 

The current inventory of plates is the sum of the plates in each set:
17 sets of plates = 17 x 51 = 867 plates
3 sets of plates = 3 x 51 = 153 plates

The total inventory of plates is 867 + 153 = 1020 plates.

problem_11,"In the service area, Oliver discovers 40 serving plates. In the beginning, Oliver divides the plates by 8, and later Oliver sets the dish total to 2 times its current amount. Finally, how many plates are in service?",40.0,10.0,"To solve this problem, we will follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Oliver starts with 40 serving plates.

Step 2: Oliver divides the plates by 8. 

To divide 40 by 8, we can perform integer division: 40 ÷ 8 = 5.

Step 3: After the division, Oliver sets the dish total to 2 times its current amount.

Since Oliver started with 40 plates and divided them by 8, the total number of plates is now 5 * 8 = 40.

Step 4: Now Oliver sets the dish total to 2 times its current amount.

The total number of plates is now 40. To find 2 times 40, we multiply 40 by 2: 40 * 2 = 80.

Step 5: Now that Oliver has set the dish total to 80, we need to find out how many plates are in service.

To find out how many plates are in service, we need to subtract the number of plates that were initially set aside (40) from the total number of plates (80): 80 - 40 = 40.

problem_16,"At the venue portal, Victoria monitors 4,200 remaining tickets. First, Victoria makes 30 more tickets available from the backup allocation. Next, after a division into 5 equal sections, a single portion stays in the count, and after that the remaining total is multiplied by 4. How many tickets are in the system?",7698.0,3384.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps as instructed:

1. Victoria makes 30 more tickets available from the backup allocation. This means the total number of tickets is now 4,200 + 30 = 4,230.

2. After a division into 5 equal sections, a single portion stays in the count. This means we divide 4,230 by 5. 

   4,230 ÷ 5 = 862.4 

   Since we can't have a fraction of a ticket, we'll round down to 862 tickets in each section.

3. After that the remaining total is multiplied by 4. 

   862 tickets * 4 = 3,468

4. Now, we need to add the original 4,230 tickets to the 3,468 tickets to find the total number of tickets in the system.

problem_23,"In the kitchen storage, Grace finds 42.65 kilograms of flour. First Grace splits the total flour into 19.41 equal parts and keeps just one part. Finally, what is the current supply of kilograms of flour? Use only 2 decimal places for your answer and any calculations shown.",4.4,2.2,"To find the current supply of flour, we first need to find out how much flour Grace keeps in each part.

We are given that Grace splits the total flour into 19.41 equal parts. To find the amount of flour in each part, we divide the total flour by the number of parts:

42.65 kg ÷ 19.41 parts = 2.2 kg per part

Now that we know how much flour is in each part, we can find out how much flour Grace keeps by multiplying the amount in each part by 1 (the part she keeps):

2.2 kg per part × 1 part = 2.2 kg

The current supply of flour is the amount in each part plus the amount Grace keeps:

2.2 kg + 2.2 kg = 4.4 kg

problem_38,"At closing time, Anna finalizes 8 financial transactions. Then, Anna keeps only one queue of transactions after breaking down the transaction total evenly into 4 queues, and later she brings the number of payment transactions to be 3 times its current number. What is the final count of transactions?",16.0,6.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Anna has 8 transactions and keeps 3 queues of transactions.

Initially, Anna has 8 transactions. 
After keeping 3 queues of transactions, Anna has 8 - 3 = 5 transactions left.

Since the transactions are divided evenly into 4 queues, we can divide the remaining transactions by 4 to find out the number of transactions in each queue.

5 transactions / 4 queues = 1.25 transactions per queue.

Since we can't have a fraction of a transaction, we'll round down to 1 transaction per queue.

So, Anna now has 4 queues with 1 transaction each.

Step 2: Anna keeps 1 queue and brings the number of payment transactions to be 3 times its current number.

Anna has 4 queues with 1 transaction each. 
The total number of transactions in these 4 queues is 4 * 1 = 4 transactions.

Anna wants to bring the number of payment transactions to be 3 times its current number. 
So, Anna will keep 1 queue with 1 transaction and add 3 times the number of transactions in the other 3 queues to it.

Payment transactions = 3 * (4 - 1) = 3 * 3 = 9 transactions.

So, Anna now has 1 queue with 1 transaction and 3 queues with 9 transactions each.

Step 3: Anna breaks down the total number of transactions evenly into 4 queues.

Total number of transactions = 1 queue with 1 transaction + 3 queues with 9 transactions each = 1 + 27 = 28 transactions.

Since the transactions are divided evenly into 4 queues, we can divide the total number of transactions by 4 to find out the number of transactions in each queue.

28 transactions / 4 queues = 7 transactions per queue.

So, Anna now has 4 queues with 7 transactions each.

Step 4: Anna has 8 transactions and keeps 1 queue.

Anna now has 4 queues with 7 transactions each and 1 queue with 1 transaction.

The total number of transactions is the sum of the transactions in all 5 queues:
8 transactions (initial) + 1 transaction (kept) + 7 transactions (in each queue) = 8 + 1 + 7 = 16 transactions.

Later, the student count becomes 2 times its current size. Finally, how many students are there now?",68.0,34.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps as instructed.

Step 1: Liam splits the total students into 2 equal parts, and the total is set to the number of students in one part.

Let's assume the total number of students is x. Since Liam splits the total into 2 equal parts, each part will have x/2 students.

Step 2: The student count becomes 2 times its current size.

After Liam splits the students into 2 equal parts, the total number of students is now 2x. We are told that this is 2 times the original number of students (x). So, we can set up the equation:

2x = 2x

This equation is always true, so we can't determine the value of x. However, we can proceed with the next steps.

Step 3: Liam adds the remaining students to the other half of the original group.

Since Liam splits the students into 2 equal parts, the remaining students will be in the other half. The original number of students was 34, so the remaining students will be 34 - 34 = 0.

Step 4: The student count becomes 2 times its current size.

Now, we need to find the total number of students after Liam adds the remaining students to the other half. This will be 2 times the current size, which is 2(34) = 68.

Step 5: Liam adds the remaining students to the other half of the original group.

problem_156,"During land assessment, Bianca evaluates 21.47 hectares of land for a farm. First the land area decreases when divided into 6.82 equal sections, with one section retained. What is the current size of the property in hectares? Give your answer and work (if shown) rounded to 2 decimal places.",1.3,3.15,"To find the current size of the property, we first need to calculate the area of each section and then add up the areas of all the sections.

Step 1: Calculate the area of each section

The total land area is 21.47 hectares. Since 6.82 equal sections are created, we need to divide the total land area by the number of sections to find the area of each section.

Area of each section = Total land area / Number of sections
= 21.47 hectares / 6.82
= 3.12 hectares

Step 2: Calculate the total area of all sections

Since one section is retained, we need to subtract it from the total area to find the total area of all sections.

Total area of all sections = Area of each section - Retained section
= 3.12 hectares - 6.82 hectares
= -3.7 hectares

However, since the negative result is incorrect, we must re-examine our steps. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Step 1: Divide the land into equal sections

Since 6.82 sections are created, we need to divide the total land area by the number of sections to find the area of each section.

Area of each section = Total land area / Number of sections
= 21.47 hectares / 6.82
= 3.12 hectares

Step 2: Add up the areas of all sections

Since one section is retained, we need to subtract it from the total area to find the total area of all sections.

Total area of all sections = Area of each section - Retained section
= 3.12 hectares - 1.82 hectares
= 1.3 hectares

problem_200,"While mixing concrete, Charlotte uses 0.51 parts cement. First Charlotte adjusts the formula by reducing cement by 0.01 parts. How many parts of cement does the final mixture contain? Round your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",0.25,0.5,"To solve this problem, we need to first find the total amount of cement in the original mixture. 

The original amount of cement is 0.51 parts.

To find the total amount of cement in the final mixture, we need to reduce the original amount by 0.01 parts. 

Let's calculate the new amount of cement:

Original amount of cement = 0.51 parts
Reduced amount of cement = 0.51 - 0.01 = 0.50 parts

Now, we need to find the total amount of cement in the final mixture. 

The total amount of cement remains the same, but the proportion of cement has changed. 

Let's find the total amount of mixture (parts):

Total amount of mixture = Original amount of cement + Reduced amount of cement
= 0.51 + 0.50
= 1.01 parts

Now, we need to find the proportion of cement in the final mixture:

Proportion of cement = Reduced amount of cement / Total amount of mixture
= 0.50 / 1.01
= 0.49

Now, we need to find the final amount of cement in the mixture:

Final amount of cement = Original amount of cement x Proportion of cement
= 0.51 x 0.49
= 0.2499

What is the final total of parts? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",0.16,0.02,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new ratio of cement to total parts after mixing.
2. Calculate the new amount of cement after it decreases by 0.04 parts.
3. Calculate the new total parts after the decrease.

Step 1: Calculate the new ratio of cement to total parts after mixing.

Let's denote the current amount of cement as C and the current total parts as T. We know that Pradeep uses 0.20 parts of cement.

The original ratio of cement to total parts is C/T = 0.20.

We are told that the new ratio is 2.25 times its present number of parts. Therefore, we can write:

(C/T) * 2.25 = 2.25

To find the new ratio, we can simplify this equation:

C/T = 2.25 / 2.25
C/T = 1

Step 2: Calculate the new amount of cement after it decreases by 0.04 parts.

The new amount of cement is 0.20 - 0.04 = 0.16 parts.

Step 3: Calculate the new total parts after the decrease.

The new total parts is T - 0.04.

Since we don't know the exact value of T, we can express the new total parts as:

T - 0.04

We know that the new ratio of cement to total parts is 0.16 / (T - 0.04).

We can set up an equation using this information:

(C/T) * (T - 0.04) = 0.16

Substituting C/T = 1, we get:

1 * (T - 0.04) = 0.16

Simplifying this equation, we get:

T - 0.04 = 0.16
T = 0.16 + 0.04
T = 0.20

The new total parts is T - 0.04 = 0.20 - 0.04 = 0.16.

Following that, the inventory of grain decreases by 2,187 tons. How many tons are available now?",1773.22,9244.0,"To solve this problem, we will follow the steps as instructed:

Step 1: 
Keiko starts with 11,431 metric tons of grain. To find the new amount after subdividing by 1, we divide 11,431 by 1. 

11,431 / 1 = 11,431 metric tons

Step 2: 
Keiko expands the total inventory to be 3 times its current size. To find the new amount, we multiply the current amount by 3.

11,431 * 3 = 34,253 metric tons

Step 3: 
Keiko diminishes the total grain amount to 1/3 of its current size. To find the new amount, we divide the current amount by 3.

34,253 / 3 = 11,771.67 metric tons

Step 4: 
Keiko diminishes the total grain amount to 1/3 of its current size. To find the new amount, we divide the current amount by 3.

problem_264,"Alexander verifies 5 financial transactions for records. First 3 transactions were deleted from the records, and next the running total grows by a factor of 3. Later, Alexander voids 5 transactions. Following that, he scales the payment up 3-fold. Given this information, how many transactions are there?",27.0,3.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: First 3 transactions were deleted from the records.

Let's assume the initial total number of transactions is x. After deleting the first 3 transactions, the new total is x - 3.

Step 2: Next the running total grows by a factor of 3.

The new total after the first 3 transactions is x - 3. Since the running total grows by a factor of 3, the new total is 3(x - 3).

Step 3: Later, Alexander voids 5 transactions.

The new total after voiding 5 transactions is 3(x - 3) - 5.

Step 4: Following that, he scales the payment up 3-fold.

The new total is 3(3(x - 3) - 5).

Now, let's simplify the expression:

3(x - 3) - 5 = 3x - 9 - 5 = 3x - 14

So, the new total is 3(3x - 14) = 9x - 42.

Now, let's add the 5 voided transactions:

9x - 42 - 5 = 9x - 47

Now, let's scale the payment up 3-fold:

(9x - 47) * 3 = 27x - 141

problem_266,"Bianca monitors 7 financial transactions for fraud. First the transaction count is divided by 7. Then, Bianca adjusts the volume of transactions to 5 times its current level. Next, Bianca brings the number of payment transactions to be 2 times its current number. How many transactions remain?",2.0,10.0,"To find the number of transactions remaining, let's solve the problem step by step.

1. The transaction count is divided by 7:
   Let the initial transaction count be x. 
   The transaction count is divided by 7, so the new transaction count is x/7.

2. Then, Bianca adjusts the volume of transactions to 5 times its current level:
   The new transaction count is 5 times the initial transaction count, so it becomes 5x/7.

3. Next, Bianca brings the number of payment transactions to be 2 times its current number:
   The new transaction count is 2 times the current transaction count, so it becomes 2x/7.

To find the number of transactions remaining, we need to subtract the new transaction count from the original transaction count:
   Original transaction count: x
   New transaction count: 5x/7
   Transactions remaining: x - 5x/7

To simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 7 to get rid of the fraction:
   Transactions remaining: x - 5x/7 = (7x - 5x)/7 = 2x/7

So, the number of transactions remaining is 2x/7.

Since we are asked to find the number of transactions remaining, we will assume x = 7 (the original transaction count) for simplicity.
   Transactions remaining: 2(7)/7 = 2

problem_272,"Raj stores 28 pieces of sports equipment for the upcoming tournament. In the beginning, Raj evenly divides the equipment into 4 groups, and proceeds to make the total equal to only one group's share, and then he separates the equipment into 7 equal amounts, and sets the total inventory size to that of a single amount's share. What is the resulting equipment count?",7.0,1.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

Step 1: Divide the equipment into 4 groups.

Since Raj divides the equipment evenly into 4 groups, each group will have 28 ÷ 4 = 7 pieces of equipment.

Step 2: Make the total equal to one group's share.

To make the total equal to one group's share, we need to add up the 4 groups, which is 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28 pieces of equipment. However, we are told that the total should be equal to only one group's share, so this is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate this step.

Step 2 (re-evaluation): Since the total should be equal to one group's share, we can re-calculate the total as follows:

- Divide the equipment into 4 groups: 7 pieces per group
- Add up the 4 groups: 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 28
- Since the total should be equal to one group's share, we need to find a way to divide the equipment into 7 groups.

Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Step 1: Divide the equipment into 4 groups.

Since Raj divides the equipment evenly into 4 groups, each group will have 28 ÷ 4 = 7 pieces of equipment.

Step 2: Divide the equipment into 7 equal amounts.

To divide the equipment into 7 equal amounts, we need to find the total number of pieces of equipment. We can do this by multiplying the number of groups (7) by the number of pieces per group (7):

7 groups x 7 pieces per group = 49 pieces

Step 3: Set the total inventory size to that of a single amount's share.

Since the total inventory size should be equal to one amount's share, we need to divide the total (49) by 7:

49 ÷ 7 = 7

Therefore, the resulting equipment count is 7."

This means Priya has created 4 intervals of 2.1 kilometers each. Since she preserved one interval, the total number of intervals is 4 + 1 = 5.

2. Now, we need to find the total length of these intervals. We can do this by multiplying the number of intervals by the length of each interval:

5 intervals * 2.1 kilometers/interval = 10.5 kilometers

3. Priya then lengthens the trail by 2.3 kilometers. We'll add this to the total length of the intervals:

10.5 kilometers + 2.3 kilometers = 13.8 kilometers

Rounded to 1 decimal place, the final answer is:

Give your answer and work (if shown) rounded to 1 decimal place.",2.5,10.8,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Amir sections the current path into 6.2 equal portions. 
11.2 km / 6.2 = 1.8 km per portion

Step 2: Amir removes all but one portion's distance. 
11.2 km - (1.8 km * 6) = 11.2 km - 10.8 km = 0.4 km

Step 3: Amir expands the course by 2.5 kilometers. 
11.2 km + 2.5 km = 13.7 km

Step 4: Amir scales up the route distance with a multiple of 2.5. 
Since Amir scales up the route distance with a multiple of 2.5, we need to multiply the expanded route distance by 2.5. 
13.7 km * 2.5 = 34.75 km

Step 5: Amir scales up the route distance with a multiple of 2.5. 
Since Amir scales up the route distance with a multiple of 2.5, we need to multiply the route distance by 2.5. 
34.75 km * 2.5 = 87.75 km

Step 6: Amir scales up the route distance with a multiple of 2.5. 
Since Amir scales up the route distance with a multiple of 2.5, we need to multiply the route distance by 2.5.

problem_340,"During inventory check, Raj counts 41 serving plates. First the dish total grows to 2 times its current amount. Later, he sets the total plates to 1/2 of the current count. What is the current inventory of plates?",0.0,41.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: The dish total grows to 2 times its current amount.

Let's assume the current count of plates is x. Then, the initial total is 41. After the first growth, the new total is 2x.

Step 2: The total plates is set to 1/2 of the current count.

Now, the new total is 1/2 of the current count, which is (1/2)x.

Since the total number of plates remains the same, we can equate the two expressions:

2x = (1/2)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

4x = x

Subtract x from both sides:

3x = 0

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 0

Since x represents the current count of plates, the current inventory of plates is 0.

Next, Charlotte divides all equipment equally among 2 areas and manages only one area, decreasing the total, and later Charlotte eliminates 2 tractors from inventory. How many tractors are in the final count?",8.0,4.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

Step 1: Charlotte expands the entire fleet to 3 times its size.

Initially, Charlotte has 4 tractors. Expanding the fleet to 3 times its size means multiplying 4 by 3:

4 * 3 = 12

So, Charlotte now has 12 tractors.

Step 2: Charlotte divides all equipment equally among 2 areas and manages only one area, decreasing the total, and later Charlotte eliminates 2 tractors from inventory.

Dividing the 12 tractors among 2 areas means dividing 12 by 2, which gives us 6:

12 / 2 = 6

However, Charlotte now manages only one area, so this means the tractors are distributed among 1 area, resulting in a total of 6 tractors in that area.

Step 3: Charlotte eliminates 2 tractors from inventory.

After eliminating 2 tractors from the 6 tractors in one area, the number of tractors in that area is now:

6 - 2 = 4

So, Charlotte has 4 tractors left in the area.

Step 4: Charlotte combines the remaining 4 tractors from the other area with the 4 tractors from the area she managed, giving her a total of 8 tractors.

Adding the 4 tractors from the other area to the 4 tractors from the managed area gives us:

2. Layla scales up the land 2.14-fold, so we multiply 36.48 by 2.14 to find the new land area:

36.48 × 2.14 = 77.94 hectares

3. Layla reduces her agricultural footprint by 2.01 hectares, so we subtract 2.01 from 77.94:

77.94 - 2.01 = 75.93 hectares

4. The land holdings become smaller by 0.99 hectares, so we subtract 0.99 from 75.93:

75.93 - 0.99 = 75.94 hectares

5. Layla splits the property by 3.39, so we divide 75.94 by 3.39:

75.94 ÷ 3.39 = 22.55 hectares

6. Finally, Layla adds 0.62 hectares to the farm:

22.55 + 0.62 = 23.17 hectares

When showing work, use only 2 decimal places for all calculations and the answer.",10.51,3.83,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

Step 1: Convert the initial GPA to points divided by 0.56

Initial GPA = 2.18
Points per GPA = 2.18 / 0.56 ≈ 3.86

Step 2: Drop 0.04 points from the current GPA

Current GPA = 3.86 - 0.04 = 3.82

Step 3: Decrease the average by 0.02 points

Let's assume the current number of students is 'x'. The new average can be expressed as:

(3.82 * x) / 0.56 = 3.82 * (x / 0.56)

Step 4: Set up an equation using the new average

3.82 * (x / 0.56) = 3.82 * x / 0.56 - 0.02

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 0.56:

3.82x = 3.82x - 0.02 * 0.56

Step 5: Simplify the equation

3.82x = 3.82x - 0.0112

Step 6: Solve for 'x'

0.0112 = 0.02 * 0.56
0.0112 = 0.0112
0 = 0

This means that the number of students remains the same. Now, we can calculate the final GPA:

Following that, he adds in 1 more serving plate from the plate storage, and next the stack increased by 3 more serving plates. Then, Hassan stacks up 2 extra serving plates from the dish pit. Next, 2 plates were taken away. How many plates are there now?",2.0,54.0,"To find the current number of serving plates, let's follow the steps as instructed:

1. Hassan starts with 2 times the current amount of plates. Let's call the current amount of plates 'x'. So, the initial number of plates is 2x.

2. He adds 1 more serving plate from the storage. So, the total number of plates becomes 2x + 1.

3. Next, he adds 3 more serving plates. So, the total number of plates becomes 2x + 1 + 3 = 2x + 4.

4. Then, he stacks up 2 extra serving plates from the dish pit. So, the total number of plates becomes 2x + 4 + 2 = 2x + 6.

5. Next, 2 plates were taken away. So, the final number of plates becomes 2x + 6 - 2 = 2x + 4.

Now, we need to find the current number of plates. Since we don't know the initial amount of plates (x), we can't determine the current number of plates. However, we can express the final number of plates as a function of x.

Give your answer and work (if shown) rounded to 2 decimal places.",20.36,6.21,"To find out how much flour is left after Ava splits the total flour into 4.27 equal parts and keeps just one part, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how much flour each part is: 
   Flour per part = Total flour / Number of parts
   Flour per part = 26.52 kg / 4.27 parts
   Flour per part ≈ 6.16 kg per part

2. Multiply the flour per part by the number of parts Ava keeps: 
   Flour kept = Flour per part * Number of parts kept
   Flour kept ≈ 6.16 kg * 1 part
   Flour kept ≈ 6.16 kg

3. Subtract the flour kept from the total flour to find the flour left: 
   Flour left = Total flour - Flour kept
   Flour left ≈ 26.52 kg - 6.16 kg
   Flour left ≈ 20.36 kg

problem_416,"Keiko activates 42 bank accounts in the system. First, Keiko holds onto a single portfolio after breaking down the accounts into 7 equal portfolios. Following that, she adds 1 more account to manage, and later 4 accounts were deactivated. Then, she splits the all accounts into 3 equal tiers and moves forward with just one tier. Now, what is the total number of accounts?",4.0,1.0,"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Keiko has 42 bank accounts.

2. She holds onto a single portfolio after breaking down the accounts into 7 equal portfolios. This means she now has 7 portfolios, each containing one account.

   So, the number of accounts in the portfolios = 7
   Total number of accounts now = 7 + 1 (the single portfolio) = 8

3. She then adds 1 more account to manage.

   So, the new total number of accounts = 8 + 1 = 9

4. Later, 4 accounts were deactivated.

   So, the number of accounts now = 9 - 4 = 5

5. She splits the all accounts into 3 equal tiers and moves forward with just one tier.

   The number of accounts in each tier = 5 / 3
   Since we can't have a fraction of an account, we'll round down to 1 (to make the division result whole).

   So, the number of accounts in each tier = 1
   The total number of accounts in one tier = 1 * 3 = 3

6. Now, she splits the accounts into 3 equal tiers and moves forward with just one tier.

problem_459,"At the training center, Ethan allocates 33 pieces of sports equipment across stations. In the beginning, Ethan partitions the equipment into 11 equal portions, keeps all but one portion. Next, he updates the inventory by adding 1 more piece of sports equipment from the equipment manager. Later, the total increases by a factor of 6. Following that, Ethan adds 4 pieces of sports equipment to the total. What is the current tally of pieces of equipment?",13.67,28.0,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Ethan allocates 33 pieces of sports equipment across 11 stations.

   Let's represent the number of pieces of equipment at each station as x. Then, we have:
   x1 + x2 + x3 +... + x11 = 33
   
2. Ethan keeps all but one portion, which means he keeps 10 portions (since 11 stations - 1 = 10).

   So, the total number of pieces of equipment Ethan keeps is 10x.

   The initial total is 33, so the number of pieces of equipment Ethan keeps is:
   10x = 33
   
   Solving for x:
   x = 33 / 10
   x = 3.3

3. Ethan updates the inventory by adding 1 piece of sports equipment from the equipment manager.

   The new total is: 33 + 1 = 34

4. Later, the total increases by a factor of 6.

   Let's represent the new total as y. Then, we have:
   y = 6y

   Solving for y:
   y = 34 / 6
   y = 5.67

5. Ethan adds 4 pieces of sports equipment to the total.

   The new total is: y + 4 = 5.67 + 4 = 9.67

6. Finally, we can calculate the current tally of pieces of equipment:

   Current total = y + 4
   Current total = 9.67 + 4
   Current total = 13.67

How many hectares make up the farm now? Keep only 2 decimal places in your answer and any work shown.",22.16,1.01,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Diego splits the land into 22.84 equal parts. To find the area of each part, we divide the total area by the number of parts:

Area per part = Total area / Number of parts
= 28.69 hectares / 22.84
≈ 1.27 hectares per part

2. The total area expands 3.21-fold. To find the new total area, we multiply the original area by the expansion factor:

New total area = Original area × Expansion factor
= 28.69 hectares × 3.21
≈ 92.91 hectares

3. After expanding, the property increases by a factor of 2.69. To find the new total area, we multiply the expanded area by the increase factor:

New total area = New total area × Increase factor
= 92.91 hectares × 2.69
≈ 249.67 hectares

4. The total area increases by a factor of 2.69, and one part is kept. To find the new total area, we multiply the expanded area by the increase factor and divide by the number of parts:

New total area = (Expanded area × Increase factor) / Number of parts
= (92.91 hectares × 2.69) / 22.84
≈ 27.43 hectares

5. Diego divides the total area by 1.24, keeping one part. To find the new total area, we divide the new total area by the division factor:

How many students are there now?",1.0,11.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: The count of students decreases to 1/5 of the current total.
- Let's assume the current total number of students is x.
- So, 1/5 * x = x/5
- To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 5:
- x = 5x/5
- x = x
- This means the count of students remains the same, x = 5x/5.

Step 2: Following that, 2 additional students were added to the roster.
- Now, the total number of students is x + 2.
- We know that x = 5x/5, so let's express x in terms of 5x:
- x = 5x/5
- Multiply both sides by 5:
- 5x = 5x
- The equation remains the same.

Step 3: Anna multiplies the student count by a factor of 4.
- Now, the total number of students is 5x * 4 = 20x.
- We know that x = 5x/5, so let's express x in terms of 5x:
- x = 5x/5
- Multiply both sides by 5:
- 5x = 5x
- The equation remains the same.

Step 4: Then, Anna removes 1 student from the total.
- Now, the total number of students is 20x - 1.
- We know that x = 5x/5, so let's express x in terms of 5x:
- x = 5x/5
- Multiply both sides by 5:
- 5x = 5x
- The equation remains the same.

Now, let's plug in the value of x in terms of 5x:
- x = 5x/5
- Multiply both sides by 5:
- 5x = 5x
- This is an identity, so we can plug in any value of x.

Let's plug in x = 1:
- x = 5x/5
- 1 = 5(1)/5
- 1 = 1
- This means the count of students remains the same, x = 1.

How many hectares make up the farm now? Round both your final answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",273.76,1.01,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Kevin divides the 73.96 hectares of land into 12.34 equal plots. To find the area of each plot, we divide the total land area by the number of plots:

73.96 hectares / 12.34 plots = 6.00 hectares per plot

Step 2: Kevin keeps one plot, so now he has 6.00 hectares of land. 

Step 3: The land area grows by a factor of 3.16. To find the new land area, we multiply the current land area by this factor:

6.00 hectares * 3.16 = 18.96 hectares

Step 4: Kevin downsizes the property by 1.13 hectares, so the new land area is:

18.96 hectares - 1.13 hectares = 17.83 hectares

Step 5: The land area grows by a factor of 3.16 again, so we multiply the current land area by this factor:

17.83 hectares * 3.16 = 56.69 hectares

Step 6: Kevin makes his land 2.47 times larger, so we multiply the current land area by this factor:

56.69 hectares * 2.47 = 139.51 hectares

Step 7: Kevin divides the land by 43.72 to keep a single portion. To find the new land area, we divide the current land area by this factor:

139.51 hectares / 43.72 = 3.17 hectares

Step 8: Kevin keeps one of the 3.17 hectares, so now he has 3.17 hectares.

To find the final answer, we add up the land area:

73.96 hectares + 6.00 hectares + 17.83 hectares + 56.69 hectares + 139.51 hectares + 3.17 hectares = 273.76 hectares

problem_580,"Sebastian measures the ground elevation at 30.7 meters height from the reference point. Then, Sebastian recalculates the elevation using a 9-way division. Later, the elevation plan is adjusted down by 1.2 meters. Following that, Sebastian adds 0.6 meters to the elevation plan. Then, the elevation becomes 3.7 times the current measurement in meters. Next, the elevation plan is modified to 3.4 times the current level in meters. What relative level in meters does the plan specify? Use only 1 decimal place for your answer and any calculations shown.",358.3,35.4,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the initial elevation after the 9-way division.

Initial elevation = 30.7 meters

Step 2: Calculate the new elevation after the adjustment down by 1.2 meters.

New elevation = Initial elevation - 1.2 meters
New elevation = 30.7 - 1.2 meters
New elevation = 29.5 meters

Step 3: Calculate the new elevation after adding 0.6 meters.

New elevation = 29.5 + 0.6 meters
New elevation = 30.1 meters

Step 4: Calculate the elevation after it becomes 3.7 times the current measurement.

Elevation = 3.7 * 30.1 meters
Elevation = 112.727 meters

Step 5: Calculate the elevation after it becomes 3.4 times the current level.

Elevation = 3.4 * 112.727 meters
Elevation = 388.999 meters

Since the question asks for the relative level in meters, we need to find the difference between the final elevation and the initial elevation.

Relative level = Final elevation - Initial elevation
Relative level = 388.999 - 30.7 meters
Relative level = 358.299 meters

What is the total number of transactions now?",30.0,15.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Initially, Pradeep has 48 transactions.

2. Pradeep breaks down the transactions into 3 queues. This means he divides 48 transactions into 3 equal parts, so each part has 48 / 3 = 16 transactions.

3. Pradeep then deletes 1 transaction from the records, so now he has 16 - 1 = 15 transactions in each queue.

4. Pradeep then makes the transaction total 3 times its current count. Since he has 15 transactions in each queue, he now has 3 * 15 = 45 transactions.

5. Pradeep breaks down the transactions into 3 queues again. This means he divides 45 transactions into 3 equal parts, so each part has 45 / 3 = 15 transactions.

What is the final rating change in points? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",-0.8975,0.1,"To find the final rating change in points, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initial running total: Let's assume the initial running total is 'x'.

2. Shift of 0.04 points: The running total is divided by 0.48, so the new running total is x / 0.48.

3. Update with a division by 0.23: Now, the running total change is (x / 0.48) - 0.04. To find the new running total, we multiply this by 0.23:

   (x / 0.48) - 0.04 * 0.23 = (x / 0.48) - 0.0092

4. Multiplication by 0.37: Now, the running total change is multiplied by 0.37:

   (x / 0.48) - 0.0092 * 0.37 = (x / 0.48) - 0.00345

5. Drop by 0.03 points: The running total change is now dropped by 0.03 points:

   (x / 0.48) - 0.00345 - 0.03 = (x / 0.48) - 0.03345

Now, we want to express this as a single fraction. To do this, we can convert the decimal 0.03345 to a fraction:

   (x / 0.48) - 0.03345 = (x / 0.48) - 0.3445/100 = (x / 0.48) - 0.03445

Now, we can rewrite the equation as a single fraction:

   (x / 0.48) - 0.03445 = 0.0002167x

Now, let's isolate x by moving all terms to one side:

   0.0002167x - (x / 0.48) = 0

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 0.48:

   0.0002167x * 0.48 - x = 0 * 0.48
   0.1035x - x = 0
   -0.8975x = 0

Now, divide both sides by -0.8975:

Next, Daniel sees the reaction time increase to 2.2 times the current number of milliseconds. How many milliseconds is the reaction time now? All calculations and the final answer should be rounded to 1 decimal place.",341.8,340.1,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

Step 1: Initial reaction time with fatigue
Reaction time = 182.3 milliseconds
Fatigue adds 20.3 milliseconds to the reaction time
New reaction time = 182.3 + 20.3 = 202.6 milliseconds

Step 2: Reaction time with practice

Round both your final answer and any steps to 1 decimal place.",10.9,2.7,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Chitra schedules 9.9 study hours for the week. To find the total number of study blocks, divide 9.9 by 3.6:

9.9 / 3.6 = 2.8

So, Chitra has 2.8 study blocks. Now, let's calculate the time for each block:

Each block is 3.6 hours long, so:

2.8 blocks * 3.6 hours/block = 10.08 hours

2. Chitra starts with 10.08 hours of study time. Now, she splits this time into 2.1 equal parts and keeps a single part:

problem_801,"Grace is surveying 18.43 hectares of land for planting. In the beginning, Grace reduces their holdings by dividing the land into 2.44 parts and keeping one. Later, Grace obtains 2.49 more hectares from a land bank. Following that, Grace leases 0.79 more hectares from a retiring farmer. Then, the land area grows by a factor of 3.62, and next the farmland expands to 2.53 times its current size. How many hectares in total? Round your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",293671.0,99.18,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

Step 1: Convert the initial land area from hectares to square meters, as it's easier to work with decimals.

Initial land area in square meters = 18.43 hectares * 10000 m²/hectare = 1843000 m²

Step 2: Divide the land into 2.44 parts and keep one part for Grace.

Land area in each part = 1843000 m² / 2.44 ≈ 753111 m²

Step 3: Subtract the part that Grace keeps from the initial land area to find the area that was reduced.

Area reduced = 1843000 m² - 753111 m² = 1169899 m²

Step 4: Add the area that Grace obtained from the land bank.

Area obtained = 2.49 hectares = 2.49 * 10000 m²/hectare = 24500 m²

Step 5: Add the area that Grace leased from the farmer.

Area leased = 0.79 hectares = 0.79 * 10000 m²/hectare = 7900 m²

Step 6: Calculate the new land area by multiplying the reduced area by the growth factor.

New land area = 1169899 m² * 3.62 ≈ 4304114 m²

Step 7: Calculate the final land area by multiplying the new land area by the growth factor.

Final land area = 4304114 m² * 2.53 ≈ 1093711 m²

Step 8: Add the final land area to the initial land area to find the total land area.

Total land area = 1843000 m² + 1093711 m² = 2936711 m²

Rounded to 2 decimal places, the total land area is approximately 293,671 m².

problem_925,"Daniel prepares 20 performers for a scene. First, the present ensemble expands to 2 times its current size. Then, he splits the current performers into 20 identical ensembles, holding onto a single ensemble. Now, what is the final performer count in the group?",21.0,2.0,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The present ensemble expands to 2 times its current size. Since there are 20 performers in the present ensemble, we multiply 20 by 2 to get the new size: 20 * 2 = 40 performers.

2. The current performers are then split into 20 identical ensembles, holding onto a single ensemble. This means that the 20 performers are divided into 20 groups of 1, with the remaining performer being kept as the ""holding onto"" ensemble. 

   Since there are 20 performers being divided into groups of 20, the number of groups will be 20 / 20 = 1. This means that the holding onto ensemble is actually the same as one of the groups. Therefore, the number of groups will be 20, and the number of performers in each group will be 20 / 20 = 1.

3. Now, we add the performer in the holding onto ensemble to the total number of performers in the groups: 20 + 1 = 21 performers.

1. Xavier reduces to 1/15.86 of the original land after division:
   Original land = 35.07 hectares
   1/15.86 of the original land = (1/15.86) * 35.07 ≈ 2.26 hectares

   So, after the first reduction, Xavier has approximately 2.26 hectares of land.

2. Then, their farmland grew by 1.65 more hectares:
   2.26 hectares (remaining land) + 1.65 hectares (growth) ≈ 3.91 hectares

3. Then, the land area decreases when divided into 2.61 equal sections, with one section retained:
   3.91 hectares / 2.61 ≈ 1.53 hectares (each section)

Since Xavier keeps only one troupe, he is left with 46 - 1 = 45 performers.

These 45 performers were divided into 2 equal troupes. 

To find the number of people in each troupe, we divide the total number of performers by 2:
45 / 2 = 22.5

Since we can't have half a person, this means that the troupes must have an odd number of performers. To make the division result in an integer, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2:
22.5 * 2 = 45
45 / 2 = 22.5

However, we can see that 45 / 2 is not a whole number, so the division is not exact. To find the correct number of performers in each troupe, we need to re-examine the division.

46 / 2 = 23

So, there are 23 performers in each troupe.

2. The number of tractors shrinks by 3-fold, which means it decreases by a factor of 3.
3. To find the decrease, multiply the initial number of tractors by 3. 
   12 * 3 = 36

4. Subtract the decrease from the initial number of tractors to find the remaining number of tractors.
   12 - 36 = -24

Since the number of tractors is negative, it means that 24 tractors actually left the shed. However, the problem asks for the total number of tractors remaining, so we need to add the number of tractors that left the shed to the initial number.

   12 + 24 = 36

What is the final temperature reading in degrees Celsius? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",0.77,0.76,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

Step 1: 
The initial temperature is 15.33 degrees Celsius. 
The temperature is corrected to 1/3.41 of its current value. 
To find the corrected temperature, we divide 15.33 by 3.41.
Corrected temperature = 15.33 / 3.41 ≈ 4.61 degrees Celsius.

Step 2: 
The monitoring system shows warming of 0.41 degrees. 
To find the new temperature, we add the warming to the corrected temperature.
New temperature = 4.61 + 0.41 ≈ 5.02 degrees Celsius.

Step 3: 
A unit conversion error is discovered, requiring all temperatures to be divided by 3.68. 
To find the corrected temperature, we divide the new temperature by 3.68.
Corrected temperature = 5.02 / 3.68 ≈ 1.37 degrees Celsius.

Step 4: 
The monitoring system shows warming of 0.35 degrees. 
To find the new temperature, we add the warming to the corrected temperature.
New temperature = 1.37 + 0.35 ≈ 1.72 degrees Celsius.
