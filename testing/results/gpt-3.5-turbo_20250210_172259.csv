problem_36,"In the pantry, Daniel discovers 26.20 kilograms of flour. First, the amount increased by 0.36 more kilograms, and later he reduces the amount of flour to 1/4.20 of the total, and later the flour amount becomes 2.18 times its current size. How many kilograms of flour are there now? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",13.77,13.78,"Step 1: Increase the amount of flour by 0.36 kilograms.
26.20 kg + 0.36 kg = 26.56 kg

problem_53,"Maya reviews 21 bank accounts for activity. First 5 accounts were terminated, according to records. Following that, the database expanded with 3 additional accounts, and later the total rises to be 2 times greater than before. How many accounts are there altogether?",7.0,38.0,"Let's denote the initial number of accounts as $P$.

Firstly, 5 accounts were terminated, so the number of accounts after termination is $P - 5$.

Then, 3 accounts were added, making the total number of accounts $(P - 5) + 3 = P - 2$.

Finally, when the total number rises to be 2 times greater than before, we have:

$2(P - 2) = P$

Expanding the equation, we get:

$2P - 4 = P$

Subtracting $P$ from both sides, we find:

$P = 4$

Therefore, the total number of accounts altogether is:

$4\text{ terminated accounts} + 3\text{ new accounts} = 7$.

Final Answer: 7"
problem_56,"William executes 18 financial transactions in the system. In the beginning, 1 more transaction was added for processing, and after that the tally of transactions reaches 2 times its current total. Then, 3 more transactions were added for processing. How many transactions are there in the end?",-1.0,41.0,"Let's denote the number of transactions initially as $x$.

1. 1 more transaction was added initially: so, $x + 1$ transactions are being processed.

2. The tally of transactions reaches 2 times its current total: $x + 1 = 2(x + 1)$  
   Solving the above equation:  
   $x + 1 = 2x + 2$  
   $x = -1$

As we cannot have a negative number of transactions, there seems to be an error in the problem setup. Let's investigate further."
problem_61,"Alexander records a percentage adjustment of -11.36 points in intensity. In the beginning, Alexander brings the percentage change in points to 1/4.65 of its value. Later, the current percentage change is multiplied by 3.53. Following that, Alexander increases the percent change in intensity by 17.41 more points. As a percentage, what is the final change as a percentage change? Round your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",8.78,8.8,"1. Find the initial adjustment in intensity after the -11.36 percentage adjustment:

When showing work, use only 1 decimal place for all calculations and the answer.",-5.0,-3.9,"Let's denote the initial percentage change as $x$.

1. After an initial change of 8 points:
$x = x + 8$

2. Scaling down the change by 1/14.8:
$x = \frac{x + 8}{14.8}$

3. Decreasing the change by 1.7 points:
$x = \frac{x + 8}{14.8} - 1.7$

4. Reducing the change by an additional 0.5 points:
$x = \frac{x + 8}{14.8} - 1.7 - 0.5$

5. Scaling the change by a factor of 2.3:
$x = 2.3 \times \left(\frac{x + 8}{14.8} - 1.7 - 0.5\right)$

Solving for $x$ gives the resulting relative performance change.

$x = 2.3 \times \left(\frac{x + 8}{14.8} - 1.7 - 0.5\right)$

$x = 2.3 \times \left(\frac{x + 8}{14.8} - 2.2\right)$

$x = 2.3 \times \left(\frac{x + 8 - 32.56}{14.8}\right)$

$x = \frac{2.3x + 18.4 - 74.968}{14.8}$

$x = 0.1554x - 4.2135$

1. The performance change from the initial benchmark is -8.1% of $B$, which is $-0.081 \times B$.
2. Scaling this change by a factor of 1/-2.1 gives $\frac{-0.081 \times B}{-2.1}$.
3. Dividing this by -3 results in $\frac{\frac{-0.081 \times B}{-2.1}}{-3}$.
4. Adding 2 points gives $\frac{\frac{-0.081 \times B}{-2.1}}{-3} + 2$.
5. Adjusting this change by a factor of 2.8 is $2.8 \times (\frac{\frac{-0.081 \times B}{-2.1}}{-3} + 2)$.

Now let's simplify this expression to find the resulting relative performance change: 
$2.8 \times (\frac{\frac{-0.081 \times B}{-2.1}}{-3} + 2) = 2.8 \times (\frac{0.03857B}{2.1} + 2) = 2.8 \times (0.0184B + 2) = 0.0515B + 5.6$.

Since we are looking for the relative performance change in percentage, we need to express it as a percentage of the initial benchmark $B$, which results in $\frac{0.0515B + 5.6}{B} \times 100 \% = 5.15\% + 560\% = 565.15\%$.

Victoria gets faster by 6.2 milliseconds: 302.8 + 6.2 = 309.0

Final Answer: 309.0 milliseconds"
problem_988,"In the system at the bank, Xavier enters a value of 494.25 dollars. In the beginning, Xavier adds another 11.56 dollars from the bank. Following that, he gains 21.29 more dollars from an account holder. Then, Xavier brings the value to 1.45 times its current amount. What is the total value in dollars? Give your answer and any work steps rounded to 2 decimal places.",763.4,764.3,"Step 1: Initial value entered by Xavier = $494.25

Step 2: Xavier adds $11.56, total becomes $494.25 + $11.56 = $505.81

Step 3: Xavier gains $21.29 from an account holder, total becomes $505.81 + $21.29 = $527.10

Step 4: Xavier brings the value to 1.45 times its current amount, total becomes $527.10 * 1.45 = $763.395

Final Answer: $763.40"
problem_996,"Yuki tracks a fluctuation of 0.34 dollars. Then, Yuki sees a further gain of 0.02 dollars come from heavy buying pressure. Later, he notes an additional rise of 0.01 dollars. Following that, Yuki calculates the change be multiplied by 0.90, and next he records a drop of 0.05 dollars. And now, how many dollars is the total change? Use only 2 decimal places for your answer and any calculations shown.",0.63,0.28,"The total change is calculated by summing up all the individual changes.

1. Initial fluctuation = 0.34
2. Further gain = 0.02
3. Additional rise = 0.01
4. Multiplying by 0.90 = (0.34 + 0.02 + 0.01) * 0.90
5. Drop = 0.05

Adding all the changes:
0.34 + 0.02 + 0.01 + (0.37 * 0.90) - 0.05 = 0.34 + 0.02 + 0.01 + 0.333 - 0.05 = 0.633

Final Answer: 0.63"
