problem_36,"In the pantry, Daniel discovers 26.20 kilograms of flour. First, the amount increased by 0.36 more kilograms, and later he reduces the amount of flour to 1/4.20 of the total, and later the flour amount becomes 2.18 times its current size. How many kilograms of flour are there now? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",13.79,13.78,"Step 1: Daniel starts with 26.20 kg of flour and adds 0.36 kg.
  26.20 + 0.36 = 26.56 kg

Step 2: The amount is then reduced to 1/4.20 of the total, meaning we multiply 26.56 by (1/4.20).
  26.56 ÷ 4.20 = 6.32 kg (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Step 3: Finally, the flour amount becomes 2.18 times its current size.
  6.32 × 2.18 = 13.79 kg (rounded to 2 decimal places)

problem_60,"Oliver records an initial change of 0.75 points in the rating. Then, the running total change drops by 0.03 points, and then the current change is multiplied by 0.23. Following that, Oliver lowers the current adjustment by 0.03 points. Now, what is the total rating change in points? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",0.86,0.14,"Step 1: Oliver records an initial change of 0.75 points.

  Running total so far = 0.75

Step 2: The running total change “drops” by 0.03 points. This means we subtract 0.03 from the running total.

  New running total = 0.75 – 0.03 = 0.72

Step 3: Now the “current change” is taken as the running total (0.72) and is multiplied by 0.23.

  Result of multiplication = 0.72 × 0.23 = 0.1656  (rounded to 2 decimals, 0.17)

Step 4: Oliver then “lowers the current adjustment by 0.03 points.” That means we subtract 0.03 from the result obtained in Step 3.

  Current adjustment = 0.17 – 0.03 = 0.14

Step 5: Add this current adjustment to the running total we had from Step 2 to get the final total rating change.

  Total rating change = 0.72 + 0.14 = 0.86

Final Answer: 0.86"
problem_68,"Ethan begins planning out their farm with 99.30 hectares of land. Then, Ethan includes 0.50 more hectares from a land trust. Later, he leases out 1.33 hectares to an agricultural cooperative, decreasing the amount of land, and later the total farmland is reduced after being split into 1.02 equal parts, with one part kept. How many hectares make up the farm now? Give your answer and any work steps rounded to 2 decimal places.",96.6,96.54,"Step 1: Begin with 99.30 hectares.
Step 2: Add 0.50 hectares → 99.30 + 0.50 = 99.80 hectares.

problem_98,"The box office assigns William 3,880 tickets to oversee. Then, 26 extra tickets are added from the event's backup block. Then, he removes 44 tickets for venue configuration, and after that the remaining number drops by 12 tickets. Next, William takes 1/7 of the current ticket total. What is the final number of available tickets?",3300.0,550.0,"Step 1: Start with 3,880 tickets.
Step 2: Add 26 extra tickets, giving 3,880 + 26 = 3,906 tickets.
Step 3: Remove 44 tickets for venue configuration, so 3,906 − 44 = 3,862 tickets.
Step 4: The ticket total then drops by 12, so 3,862 − 12 = 3,850 tickets.
Step 5: William takes 1/7 of the current tickets. Taking 1/7 means he removes (1/7) × 3,850 = 550 tickets, leaving 3,850 − 550 = 3,300 tickets.

  F = M₂ × (1/2.27) = [ (T/2.32) − 0.30 ] / 2.27.

We are told that finally F = 15.62°C. Therefore, we have the equation

  [(T/2.32) − 0.30] / 2.27 = 15.62.

Step‐1. Multiply both sides by 2.27:
  T/2.32 − 0.30 = 15.62 × 2.27.

Step‐2. Compute 15.62 × 2.27. (15.62×2 = 31.24 and 15.62×0.27 ≈ 4.2174, so in total about 35.4574):
  T/2.32 − 0.30 = 35.4574.

Step‐3. Add 0.30 to both sides:
  T/2.32 = 35.4574 + 0.30 = 35.7574.

Step‐4. Multiply both sides by 2.32:
  T = 35.7574 × 2.32.

Step‐5. Compute 35.7574 × 2.32. (35.7574×2 = 71.5148 and 35.7574×0.32 ≈ 11.4424; adding these gives about 82.9572):
  T ≈ 82.96.

Thus, the current soil temperature is approximately 82.96°C.
