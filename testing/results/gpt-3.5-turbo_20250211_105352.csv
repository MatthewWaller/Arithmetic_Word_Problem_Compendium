Next, 36 additional tickets become available from the additional seating area. How many tickets are in the system?",2929.0,136.0,"1. To find the number of tickets initially allocated, we need to first find the total number of tickets in 23 equal sections.
Total tickets in 23 equal sections = 23 * (3059/23)
Total tickets in 23 equal sections = 3059

2. Out of the total tickets in 23 equal sections, one portion stays in the count, which means:
Remaining tickets = Total tickets in 23 equal sections - 1 portion
Remaining tickets = 3059 - 3059/23
Remaining tickets = 3059 - 133
Remaining tickets = 2926
