problem_1,"The electronic timing system measures an athletic reaction time of 340.4 milliseconds. In the beginning, the measurement shows an improvement of 10.2 milliseconds. Following that, she sees a 2.1-fold reduction in the reaction time in milliseconds. What is the resulting reaction time in milliseconds? All calculations and the final answer should be rounded to 1 decimal place.",167.0,157.2,"1. Add the improvement to the original reaction time:
340.4 milliseconds + 10.2 milliseconds = 350.6 milliseconds.

2. Calculate the reduction factor:
2.1-fold reduction = 1 / 2.1 ≈ 0.4762.

3. Reduce the reaction time by multiplying it with the reduction factor:
350.6 milliseconds * 0.4762 ≈ 167 milliseconds.

Final Answer: 167.0 milliseconds"
problem_3,"Noah stocks 10 building materials in the warehouse. First, Noah diminishes the material total to 1/3 its current size.

What is the total adjustment as a percentage change? Use only 2 decimal places for your answer and any calculations shown.",23.51,23.56,"1. Percentage adjustment made by Pradeep = 61.62 points

2. Pradeep uses a division by 4 on the percentage change: 61.62 / 4 = 15.405

3. The total percentage change as a number of points becomes 1/2.52 of what it was: 15.405 / 2.52 ≈ 6.10833

4. The present percentage change, as a percentage, undergoes a multiplication by 3.85: 6.10833 * 3.85 ≈ 23.5095%

Therefore, the total adjustment as a percentage change is approximately 23.51%.

Final Answer: 23.51%"
problem_24,"While stocking, Qiara counts 29 building materials. Then, Qiara separates the supply into 8 equal lots, choosing one lot, and trashing the others. Following that, the quantity of materials reaches 2 times its current level, and after that Qiara stocks 5 more from the supply warehouse, increasing the total. How many building materials are in stock?",11.0,13.0,"Initially, Qiara has 29 building materials.

After separating into 8 equal lots, and choosing only one lot, the quantity becomes 29/8 = 3.625, but since we can't have decimal parts of material, it is rounded down to 3.

So, the total quantity of materials becomes 3.

After doubling the current quantity, the materials increase to 3 * 2 = 6.

Then, Qiara stocks 5 more materials, making the total 6 + 5 = 11.

1. After dividing by 10 and keeping one part, the total becomes \( \frac{x}{10} \).
2. After subtracting 2 calories, the total is \( \frac{x}{10} - 2 \).
3. When the total becomes 4 times its current size: \( 4(\frac{x}{10} - 2) = x \).
4. Simplifying the equation: \( 4(\frac{x}{10}) - 8 = x \).
5. Solving for \( x \): \( \frac{4x}{10} - 8 = x \) 

\( \frac{4x}{10} - 8 = x \)  
\( \frac{4x}{10} - x = 8 \)  
\( \frac{4x - 10x}{10} = 8 \)
