problem_43,"Xavier is measuring soil temperature. The soil sensor reads 14.31 degrees Celsius. In the beginning, the soil warms by 0.49 degrees. Later, the temperature sensor is recalibrated, adjusting all readings to 1/2.85 of their current value, and next a data correction multiplies all temperature values by 2.53. Following that, the temperature sensor is recalibrated, adjusting all readings to 1/2.42 of their current value. What is the current soil temperature in degrees Celsius? Round your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",5.42,5.43,"Start with the initial soil temperature:
\[ 14.31 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Next, the soil warms up by 0.49 degrees:
\[ 14.31 + 0.49 = 14.80 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

The sensor is then recalibrated, adjusting the readings to 1/2.85 of their current value:
\[ 14.80 \div 2.85 = 5.19 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Following this recalibration, a data correction multiplies all temperature values by 2.53:
\[ 5.19 \times 2.53 = 13.13 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Lastly, the temperature sensor is recalibrated again, adjusting all readings to 1/2.42 of their current value:
\[ 13.13 \div 2.42 = 5.42 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

problem_45,"Alexander instructs 28 students during the lesson. Then, 4 additional students were enrolled. Later, Alexander splits the total students into 16 equal parts, and the total is set to the number of students in one part. Following that, the class welcomed 4 more students. What is the total number of students?",36.0,6.0,"1. Initially, Alexander has 28 students.

2. 4 additional students join, so the total becomes:
   \[ 28 + 4 = 32 \] students.

3. Alexander then splits these 32 students into 16 equal parts:
   \[ 32 \div 16 = 2 \]
   The value is set to this result, so the new total is 2 students.

4. However, this interpretation appears a bit unusual. Let's reconsider a more logical approach: After splitting into 16 parts, the result of 2 might mean each part consists of 2 students. So the total number remains 32 (not reduced to 2).

5. Later, 4 more students join the class:
   \[ 32 + 4 = 36 \] students.

Final Answer: 36"

Following that, Thomas leases out 1.37 hectares to a land bank, decreasing the amount of land. Then, Thomas splits the property by 12.08, resulting in a smaller plot. Now, how many hectares are there? Express your answer and any intermediate steps to 2 decimal places.",19.38,1.6,"Step 1: Calculate initial land amount plus additional land
Thomas starts with 18.82 hectares and adds 1.93 hectares from another source.
\[ 18.82 \text{ hectares} + 1.93 \text{ hectares} = 20.75 \text{ hectares} \]

Step 2: Subtract the land leased out to the land bank
Thomas then leases out 1.37 hectares, reducing the total amount of land.
\[ 20.75 \text{ hectares} - 1.37 \text{ hectares} = 19.38 \text{ hectares} \]

Step 3: Split the remaining property into a smaller plot
Thomas then splits the property by 12.08. This step is ambiguous, but assuming it means he splits 1 plot into 12.08 equal parts, or something more complex, such as reducing by the size of 12.08 hectares isn't clear contextually. However, if treating it simply, it seems the total would remain 19.38 hectares since no subtraction was specified.

problem_433,"Jack reviews 34 bank accounts for activity. Then, another 4 accounts were added, and then he divides the account number by 19. Next, Jack holds onto a single portfolio after breaking down the accounts into 2 equal portfolios. Now, how many accounts are there?",38.0,1.0,"1. Jack starts with reviewing 34 bank accounts.
2. Another 4 accounts are added. Therefore, \( 34 + 4 = 38 \) accounts.

4. However, since Jack holds onto a single portfolio after breaking the accounts into 2 equal portfolios, he ultimately retains only one of these portfolios.

Considering each portfolio retains all accounts from one of the grouping steps and he holds one portfolio, the number of accounts in that portfolio should logically be the total number of accounts, as both portfolios would have the total amount of accounts divided equally among them.

Since Jack initially had 38 accounts, and divided them into 2 equal portfolios but kept one, the number he retains in the portfolio he keeps would be the total number of accounts:

What is the final shift as a percentage change? Make sure to round both your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",257.01,43.5,"Let's break down the process step by step:

1. Initial percentage change = \( X \).

2. The percentage change drops by 21.74 points:
   \[ X_{\text{after drop}} = X - 21.74 \]

3. The next shift changes it to \( \frac{1}{5.87} \) of its previous value:
   \[ X_{\text{after fraction}} = \frac{X_{\text{after drop}}}{5.87} \]
   Substituting \( X_{\text{after drop}} \) from the previous step:
   \[ X_{\text{after fraction}} = \frac{X - 21.74}{5.87} \]

4. The percentage change is then multiplied by 2.81:
   \[ X_{\text{final}} = 2.81 \cdot \frac{X - 21.74}{5.87} \]

5. We know the final value \( X_{\text{final}} \) is given as 112.63 (equating the two and solving for \( X \)):
   \[ 2.81 \cdot \frac{X - 21.74}{5.87} = 112.63 \]

6. Solving for \( X \):
   \[ \frac{X - 21.74}{5.87} = \frac{112.63}{2.81} \]
   Calculating the right-hand side:
   \[ \frac{112.63}{2.81} = 40.08 \]
   \[ X - 21.74 = 40.08 \times 5.87 \]
   \[ X - 21.74 = 235.27 \]
   \[ X = 235.27 + 21.74 \]
   \[ X = 257.01 \]

So the initial percentage change before the adjustments is 257.01. We need to find the incremental difference, therefore,
\[ \text{Final shift} = X - X_{\text{initial}} = 257.01 - 0 = 257.01 \]

  1. Before the last decrease (1,466 tons), the silo would have \( 1,514 + 1,466 = 2,980 \) metric tons.
  2. Before the second removal (3,729 tons), multiply capacity by 5 (factor by which it was divided): \( 2,980 \times 5 = 14,900 \) metric tons.
  3. Before the first removal, add the grain removed at the first step: \( 14,900 + 4,592 = 19,492 \) metric tons.
  4. This should be the original capacity of the silo as it started with: 19,492 metric tons.
