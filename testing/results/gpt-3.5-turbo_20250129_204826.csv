problem_1,"Olivia procures 7 building materials for building. In the beginning, the current total of building materials is divided into 7 equal shares, and all but one share is disposed of. Next, Olivia acquires 5 more building materials from the distribution center. What is the current supply of building materials?",14.0,6.0,"Let's denote the total number of building materials Olivia procures as $x$.

After dividing the total into 7 equal shares, each share will have $\frac{x}{7}$ building materials.

When all but one share is disposed of, Olivia is left with $\frac{x}{7}$ building materials.

After acquiring 5 more building materials, the current supply of building materials is $\frac{x}{7} + 5$.

Since we know that $\frac{x}{7} + 5 = 7$, we can solve for $x$:

$\frac{x}{7} + 5 = 7$

$\frac{x}{7} = 2$

$x = 14$

Therefore, the current supply of building materials is 14.

Final Answer: 14"
problem_2,"While planning a training course, William measures out 33.9 kilometers. Then, William separates the current route into 5.7 equal sections, and keeps only one section's distance. How many kilometers is the complete route? Round both your final answer and any steps to 1 decimal place.",33.6,5.9,"To find the total distance of the complete route, we need to multiply the distance of one section by the total number of sections.

Total distance of one section = 33.9 km / 5.7 = 5.9 km

problem_8,"In the classroom, Fatima teaches 15 students. First Fatima splits the total students into 5 equal parts, and the total is set to the number of students in one part, and after that the class size expands 4-fold. Finally, how many students are there now?",60.0,12.0,"Initially, Fatima splits the total students into 5 equal parts, so each part has \(15 \div 5 = 3\) students.

When the class size expands 4-fold, the number of students in each part becomes \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

Since there were 5 parts, the total number of students now is \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

problem_9,"At the plating station, Maya has 51 serving plates. First, Maya holds onto just one set of plates after breaking the total into 17 equal sets, and after that she holds onto just one set of plates after breaking the total into 3 equal sets. What is the current inventory of plates?",17.0,1.0,"First, let's find out how many plates Maya had initially before breaking them into sets.

Let x be the total number of plates initially.

After breaking the plates into 17 equal sets, Maya holds onto 1 set, which means she has x/17 plates.

After breaking the plates into 3 equal sets, Maya holds onto 1 set, which means she has x/3 plates.

Since Maya ends up with the same number of plates in both scenarios, we can set up the equation:

x/17 = x/3

Solving for x:

3x = 17x
3 = 17

This equation has no solution, which means there is an error in the problem statement. Let's reevaluate the problem."
problem_16,"At the venue portal, Victoria monitors 4,200 remaining tickets. First, Victoria makes 30 more tickets available from the backup allocation. Next, after a division into 5 equal sections, a single portion stays in the count, and after that the remaining total is multiplied by 4. How many tickets are in the system?",13536.0,3384.0,"Step 1: Victoria makes 30 more tickets available, increasing the total number of tickets to 4,200 + 30 = 4,230 tickets.

Step 2: After dividing the total number of tickets into 5 equal sections, one portion stays in the count. This means 4,230 / 5 = 846 tickets are in each section, and one section remains, totaling 846 tickets.

Step 3: After one section is kept, the remaining total is 4,230 - 846 = 3,384 tickets.

Step 4: The remaining total is then multiplied by 4, resulting in 3,384 * 4 = 13,536 tickets in the system.

Keep only 1 decimal place in your answer and any work shown.",0.0089,-16.0,"Step 1: Calculate the actual change in performance from the initial benchmark.
2.4% of the initial benchmark = 2.4/100 = 0.024
Final change = 0.024

Step 2: Divide the change by 12.9.
Final change / 12.9 = 0.024 / 12.9 = 0.0019

Step 3: Decrease the change by 1.1%.
New change = 0.0019 - (0.0019 * 1.1/100) = 0.0019 - 0.000021 = 0.001879

Step 4: Decrease the change by 2.4%.
New change = 0.001879 - (0.001879 * 2.4/100) = 0.001879 - 0.0000451 = 0.0018339

Step 5: Multiply the change by 2.3.
New change = 0.0018339 * 2.3 = 0.004218

This step doesn't make sense mathematically. Let's correct the mistake.

Given that Raj has 28 pieces of sports equipment, the correct equation should be:
$28 = \frac{28}{4}$

Solving for $x$:
$28 = 7$

Therefore, the resulting equipment count is $\boxed{7}$.

Make sure to round both your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",486.89,16.23,"Let's denote the initial percentage change observed by Daniel as \( x \).

1. First, Daniel makes the total percentage change be 1/5.33 of what it was:
New percentage change = \( \frac{1}{5.33} \times x \) = \( \frac{x}{5.33} \) = 0.1875x

2. After that, the running total of percentage change drops by 18.88:
New percentage change = 0.1875x - 18.88

3. Later, the running total of percentage change drops by 20.27:
New percentage change = 0.1875x - 18.88 - 20.27 = 0.1875x - 38.15

4. Following that, the present percentage change total drops by 24.26:
New percentage change = 0.1875x - 38.15 - 24.26 = 0.1875x - 62.41

Given that the final observed percentage change is 424.48%, we have:
0.1875x - 62.41 = 424.48

problem_415,"Anna's performance assessment indicates a change of 8.4 percent from an initial benchmark. First the change is scaled with a division by 0.9. Later, the change decreases by 1.9 percent. What is the final performance change? Keep only 1 decimal place in your answer and any work shown.",7.5,7.4,"Let's denote the initial benchmark as $B$.

The change of 8.4 percent from the initial benchmark is calculated as $0.084 \times B$.

Scaling this change by dividing by 0.9 gives us $\frac{0.084 \times B}{0.9} = 0.0933 \times B$.

Now, the change decreases by 1.9 percent, which means we need to subtract $0.019 \times 0.0933 \times B$ from the scaled change.

The final performance change is $0.0933 \times B - 0.019 \times 0.0933 \times B = 0.0749 \times B$.

Therefore, the final performance change is 7.5 percent.

Multiplying both sides by 3.81 to clear the fraction:

$3.81x + 3.81 \times 267.48 = x$

$3.81x + 1019.1088 = x$

Subtracting $3.81x$ from both sides:

$1019.1088 = -2.81x$

Dividing by $-2.81$ to solve for $x$:

$x = \frac{1019.1088}{-2.81}$

$x \approx -362.88$

Therefore, the final shift as a percentage change is $-362.88 + 267.48 = -95.40$ percent.

Then, Jack makes each section 3.69 times larger, and next the property expanded with 1.28 more hectares, and later 1.74 hectares were sold from their property. What is the final area in hectares? Make sure to round both your answer and any steps to 2 decimal places.",3.62,3.64,"Step 1: Jack breaks up the 36.20 hectares of land into 32.13 sections, holding onto only one section.
Each section size = 36.20 hectares / 32.13 sections = 1.1256 hectares
Remaining land after keeping one section = 1.1256 hectares

Step 2: The land is split by 1.02, leaving Jack with just one portion.
Remaining land after splitting = 1.1256 hectares / 1.02 = 1.1047 hectares

Step 3: Jack makes each section 3.69 times larger.
New section size = 1.1047 hectares * 3.69 = 4.0772 hectares

Step 4: The property expanded with 1.28 more hectares.
Total land area after expansion = 4.0772 hectares + 1.28 hectares = 5.3572 hectares

Step 5: 1.74 hectares were sold from the property.
Final land area = 5.3572 hectares - 1.74 hectares = 3.6172 hectares

problem_919,"Indira completes 7 financial transactions for clients. In the beginning, Indira splits the total transactions into 7 equal groups, keeps one, and discards the remainder. How many transactions are there?",56.0,1.0,"Let the total number of transactions be represented by $x$. 

When Indira splits the total transactions into 7 equal groups, she keeps one group and discards the remainder. This means that the total number of transactions is divisible by 7.

So, we can write the equation: $x = 7n$, where $n$ is an integer representing the number of transactions in each group.

Since Indira keeps one group, the total number of transactions is $x = 7n + n = 8n$.

Since we know that $x$ is divisible by 7, we can conclude that $8n$ is divisible by 7. The smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this condition is $n = 7$.

Therefore, the total number of transactions is $x = 8 \times 7 = 56$.
