problem_21,"While operating lights, Pradeep tracks a percentage adjustment of 61.62 points in intensity. Then, Pradeep uses a division by 4 on the percentage change. Then, he makes the total percentage change as a number of points be 1/2.52 of what it was, and later the present percentage change, as a percentage, undergoes a multiplication by 3.85. What is the total adjustment as a percentage change? Use only 2 decimal places for your answer and any calculations shown.",23.53,23.56,"Step 1: Initial adjustment in percentage points:
Pradeep observes an adjustment of \( 61.62 \) points in intensity.

Step 2: Division by 4:
\[ 
\frac{61.62}{4} = 15.405 
\]
Hence, the new adjustment becomes \( 15.405 \) points.

Step 3: Timed by the factor \( \frac{1}{2.52} \):
\[ 
15.405 \times \frac{1}{2.52} \approx 6.1127 
\]
Now, the adjustment is \( 6.1127 \) points.

Step 4: Multiplication by \( 3.85 \):
\[ 
6.1127 \times 3.85 \approx 23.5349 
\]

To maintain two decimal places as instructed, round \( 23.5349 \) to \( 23.53 \).

problem_24,"While stocking, Qiara counts 29 building materials. Then, Qiara separates the supply into 8 equal lots, choosing one lot, and trashing the others. Following that, the quantity of materials reaches 2 times its current level, and after that Qiara stocks 5 more from the supply warehouse, increasing the total. How many building materials are in stock?",11.0,13.0,"Step 1: Qiara starts with 29 building materials.

Step 2: Qiara separates these 29 materials into 8 equal lots.  
To find how many materials are in each lot, we need to divide the total number of materials by the number of lots:
\[ \frac{29}{8} \approx 3.625 \]
However, since we cannot have a fraction of a building material in each lot, we consider only the integer part, which means each lot consists of 3 materials. Thus, we recalculate the total materials considered in the lots as:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
(The remaining 5 materials are not considered in the lots.)

Step 3: Qiara chooses one lot and trashes the others. Since each lot has 3 materials and she keeps one lot, she now has:
\[ 3 \text{ materials} \]

Step 4: The quantity of materials then reaches 2 times its current level:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ materials} \]

Step 5: Qiara then stocks 5 more building materials from the supply warehouse, increasing the total:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ materials} \]

problem_107,"Benjamin tracks 9 financial transactions in the database. First the queue expanded with 4 additional transactions, and after that he removes 1 transaction, and then Benjamin keeps only one queue of transactions after breaking down the transaction total evenly into 10 queues. Given this information, how many transactions are there?",12.0,1.0,"Here is the problem-solving step by step:

1. Benjamin starts with 9 transactions in his database.
2. He adds 4 more transactions, bringing the total to \(9 + 4 = 13\) transactions.
3. He then removes 1 transaction from the queue, which decreases the total to \(13 - 1 = 12\) transactions.
4. Benjamin then evenly breaks down these 12 transactions into 10 separate queues. Each queue ends up with \( \frac{12}{10} = 1.2 \) transactions, but since transactions cannot be fractionally considered, each queue has either 1 or 2 complete transactions. This fraction suggests he could not actually split all transactions equally into 10 queues with each having the same number of transactions without fragmenting a transaction.

What is the final storage capacity in tons?",4296.6,4297.0,"To find the final storage capacity in tons, we will follow the sequence of changes applied by Emma step by step.

1. **Starting Capacity:**
   \[ \text{Initial grain storage} = 30,318 \text{ tons} \]

2. **First Decrease by a Factor of 5:**
   Divide the initial storage by 5 to find the new storage amount.
   \[ \text{New Storage after decrease by factor of 5} = \frac{30,318}{5} = 6,063.6 \text{ tons} \]

3. **Reduction by 3,791 Tons:**
   Subtract 3,791 tons from the current storage.
   \[ \text{Storage after the reduction} = 6,063.6 - 3,791 = 2,272.6 \text{ tons} \]

4. **Reduction to \( \frac{1}{1} \) of its Current Size:**
   Reducing any quantity to \( \frac{1}{1} \) of its size just gives the current amount.
   \[ \text{Storage remains} = 2,272.6 \text{ tons} \]

5. **Increase by 2,024 Tons:**
   Add 2,024 tons to the current storage.

If she takes one set, and each set is modeled as a single plate represented fairly from the total of 23 (since \(23 \div 21\) is roughly \(1.095\) and operations afterward, like breaking exactly into sets, aren't clearly defined, we can assume she ends up simply with 23 plates after all operations mentioned).

3. **Splitting the inventory into 3 equal batches**: With 5 building materials, they are split into 3 batches. Each batch would ideally have \( \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \) building materials. Since it's not possible to split a building material into fractional parts in this context, we assume 2 of the batches will have 1 material and 1 batch will have 3 materials, or some other configuration like 1, 1, and 3. Feng selects just one batch. Let's assume in this practical situation, he takes the batch with 3 materials since he has a choice.

4. **Splitting the present supply into 2 equal parts**: The 3 materials are then split into 2 equal parts (which would be 1.5 each) but again, materials cannot be necessarily split fractionally, so he splits as 1 and 2.

After removal = 34,730 tons - 3,711 tons = 31,019 tons

Step 3: Subtract the tons lost due to the mishap:
After mishap = 31,019 tons - 1,384 tons = 29,635 tons

Step 4: Ismail then reduces the available grain four times smaller:
Reduced amount = 29,635 tons / 4 = 7,408.75 tons

Step 5: Add the tons from the new silo:
Final amount = 7,408.75 tons + 1,948 tons = 9,356.75 tons

What is the final storage capacity in tons?",1906.31,3813.0,"Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the initial amount of grain given:

1. Initial amount of grain = 29,190 metric tons.
2. Amelia gains more grain: \( 29,190 + 1,311 = 30,501 \) tons.
3. The supply is subdivided by 4, so she keeps just one portion: \( \frac{30,501}{4} = 7,625.25 \) tons.
4. Amelia then diminishes the total amount to 1/2 of its current size: \( 7,625.25 \times 0.5 = 3,812.625 \) tons.
5. Finally, Amelia splits the total grain again and keeps one section (the problem seems to imply another halving, assuming splitting it into two equal sections, but only keeps one): \( 3,812.625 \times 0.5 = 1,906.3125 \) tons.

Since the final elevation is -3.6 meters after multiplying by the scaling factors, we investigate this relation:

Given that -1.1 meters is the target after the first two operations (-0.5 scaled by 2.2), no transformation is needed to arrive at the target from the multiple steps. It is thereby correct to state that the plan specifies an increase of 0 meters relatively to reach a target of -1.1 meters.

Rethinking the process:
   - The problem states the number is divided by 19, but if we divide 21 performers by 19, we are left with an unrealistic number for counting individuals. There is no sensible interpretation here other than the expression ""divided by 19"" might have been meant as ""reaches a total when a unit 19 is implicated.""

Therefore, possibly a misinterpretation in what the process involves with division:
   - The ensemble size ends up being 21, before any division, and it aligns with common sense because 21 performers can be a whole number.

problem_939,"A base recipe provides 1,057 calories, Emma calculates. First, Emma splits the current calories into 10 equal portions, keeping just one portion. Later, a decrease of 2 calories is applied to the calculation, and later the calorie estimate is revised to add 4 additional calories. How many calories remain in the serving?",107.7,108.0,"First, let's calculate the number of calories in one portion after Emma splits the original amount into 10 equal portions:
\[ \text{Calories per portion} = \frac{1057 \text{ calories}}{10} = 105.7 \text{ calories} \]

Next, Emma keeps just one portion:
\[ \text{Calories kept} = 105.7 \text{ calories} \]

Then, she decreases the calories by 2:
\[ \text{Calories after decrease} = 105.7 \text{ calories} - 2 \text{ calories} = 103.7 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, Emma revises the calorie estimate to add 4 calories:
\[ \text{Final calories} = 103.7 \text{ calories} + 4 \text{ calories} = 107.7 \text{ calories} \]

problem_957,"The campus bookstore has 38 textbooks in stock for Alexander to manage. First, Alexander added 4 additional textbooks, and next Alexander withdraws 1 textbook, lowering the total. Following that, Alexander splits the current books into 24 identical portions, holding onto a single portion. Finally, what is the total number of textbooks?",1.0,2.0,"1. Start with 38 textbooks.
2. Alexander adds 4 textbooks: \( 38 + 4 = 42 \) textbooks.
3. Alexander withdraws 1 textbook: \( 42 - 1 = 41 \) textbooks.
4. Alexander splits the remaining books into 24 identical portions: \( 41 \div 24 \) does not evenly divide, so he likely keeps one of these portions.
   
   To determine how many books are in a portion: 
   Since \( 41 \div 24 \) is an uneven division, we get the floor value in whole number for practical purposes:
   \[ \text{Floor}(41 / 24) = 1 \text{ textbook per portion} \]
   
5. Alexander holds onto 1 portion which contains 1 textbook.

problem_958,"Noah coaches 36 performers for a routine. Then, Noah casts 2 more performers from the performing arts school, raising the total. Then, he cuts 1 performer from the current lineup, bringing down the total. Next, the total number of performers is divided by 13. What is the final count of performers in the ensemble?",2.0,3.0,"1. Start with the original count of performers:
   \( 36 \) performers.

2. Noah casts 2 more performers:
   \( 36 + 2 = 38 \) performers.

3. Noah cuts 1 performer from the current lineup:
   \( 38 - 1 = 37 \) performers.

4. The total number of performers is then divided by 13:
   \( 37 \div 13 \approx 2.846 \).

Since we are dealing with a count of people, which must be an integer, we round \( 2.846 \) to the nearest whole number. By the context, however, this is more sensible to consider as whole division, yielding:
   \( 37 \div 13 = 2 \) with remainder 11 (since fractional performers are not physically possible here, and we're considering how many full groups of 13 can be formed).
